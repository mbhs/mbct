                    <p class="is-size-5">Welcome new and returning Computer Team members! Before coming to our first meeting on September 21, make sure you have filled out and submitted the MCPS Extracurricular Activity COVID Form (linked above under General Resources). Note that this form must be completed for every club you plan on attending, so even if you have already filled out this form for another club, you must fill it out again for Computer Team. Additionally, this form must be submitted to Computer Team through our Sign-Up form (<strong>in addition</strong> to the MCPS link). Please have a copy of the MCPS ECA COVID Form available (preferably as a PDF) so that you can upload it on our sign-up sheet during the first meeting. You can also hand it in to Ms. Blasko in-person.</p>
                    <p class="is-size-5">You must also scan a QR code and fill out a Google Form each time you attend a club (most likely for contact tracing purposes). For Computer Team, the QR code is posted on the cabinets near the entrance of Room 328. You can also access the form through the "Daily Sign-In/Sign-Out Form" link under General Resources.</p>

                    <p class="is-size-5">Hello Computer Team members! Remember that you must submit the MCPS ECA COVID form before coming to the next meeting or we will not be able to let you in. The form must be submitted to MCPS through the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSft0QuK0UbvIkoh7_MX6uLVJay0z8YXdLmgZptd_sAjQ3Ra0A/viewform">Google Form</a> linked under General Resources. The form also needs to be submitted through Computer Team. You may do so by handing it in to our club sponsor, Ms. Blasko, in-person or by submitting it online through our Sign-Up form. The <a href="/signupform">Sign-Up form</a> should still be completed even if you hand in the form to Ms. Blasko in-person so that we have a record of you doing so and to keep our mailing list up to date.</p>
                    <p class="is-size-5">Remember that you must also scan a QR code and fill out a Google Form each time you attend a club.
